# Remote_Connect
"Remote Connect is a web-based platform, Empowering remote work and rural communities worldwide. Join us to bridge borders and unlock boundless opportunities."
# ðŸ’¡Inspiration
Coming from rural background me and my friends have always faced problems competing in the global job market due to lack of skills and since there is very little 
awarness regarding skills and job opportunities on global level and no one really gets to learn and get skilled & even after getting relevant skills students from rural background cant really afford to live in a city and do jobs.So Remote work becomes a really great option for students where they dont have to leave there town they get skills and they get to do job there itself where there is no extra cost.So this is the inspiration behind building this platform Remote Connect whos motto is
"Empowering Rural Communities Globally through Remote Work".Another major benefit is Talent retention as the skilled people are not leaving the remote areas so this helps to local business and which boost up the local Economy. also the number of people going to city gets reduced and cities dont get overcrowded and whch helps in reducing poolution so we head towards a sustainable future.
Remote Connect is bridging the gap between minorities in tech from rural areas upskilling them to compete with high skilled people from urban areas.
# ðŸ¤– What it does?
Remote connect is platform which connects minorities from rural areas who want to upskills themselves and get hired and compete in the global market.Our platform brings in mentors who are already working at a higher level in tech field and want to give back to society can come and contribute, teach, be mentor on our platform.
Our platform provide various features such Tutorials where beginners can start then once they learned a skill its time to appply it by Building Projects in our projects section and then it time to compete for prizes by participating in Hackathons.and finally comes the Job part where other platforms lack but we provide authentic Job portals where the individual can apply and get hired and get his deserving REMOTE JOB.
# ðŸ”¨ How we built.
This basic structure of our web page is designed using HTML and then we used CSS for overall styling and wherever we needed images we used it.
in features Tutorials section by selecting a topic user gets directed to that particular playlist on youtube this is done using <a> tag.
# âš¡Challenges we ran into.
Building basic page structure was easy while adding features when we wanted to be redirected to new page where all the links were mention we had problem doing that and then we faced problem in alignment of many elements.
# ðŸŽ‰ Accomplishments that we're proud of

# ðŸ§ What we learned.
This was our first project in any hackathon we learned that we should not code just to pass our college exams but we can build some real world projects that can really impact society and change things for good.
